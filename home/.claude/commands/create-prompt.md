# Create Prompt

Transform user requests into detailed, precise prompts optimised for AI model consumption.

## Core Task

Rewrite the user's request as a clear, specific, and complete prompt that guides an AI model to produce the desired output without ambiguity. Treat the output as specification language, not casual natural language.

## Process

1. **Read and understand** - Read the user's request carefully to understand the full context, intent, and all details
2. **Plan the rewrite** - Consider what specific information, instructions, or context the AI model needs to fulfill the request effectively
3. **Rewrite as a detailed prompt** - Transform the request into a precise prompt with clarity, specificity, and completeness

## Writing Guidelines

### Structure

- Begin with a single short paragraph summarising the overall task
- Use headings (##, ###, ####) for sections only where appropriate (no first-level title)
- Use **bold**, _italics_, bullet points (`-`), and numbered lists (1., 2.) liberally for organisation
- Never use emojis
- Never use `*` for bullet points, always use `-`
- Never use `---` to delimit sections
- Never use markdown table formatting or other way to make the prompt look "nicer", this is helpful for humans but not for AI

### Language

- Use plain, straightforward, precise language
- Avoid embellishments, niceties, or creative flourishes
- Think of language as specification/code, not natural language
- Be clear and specific in all instructions

### Content

- Keep the prompt concise: 0.75X to 1.5X the length of the original request
- Do not add or invent information not present in the input
- Do not include unnecessary complexity or verbosity

## Output

Provide only the final prompt as markdown, without additional commentary or explanation.
