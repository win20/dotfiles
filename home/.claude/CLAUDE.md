## Don't do
- Do not stage or commit changes to git
- Do not create tests or show change summaries
- Do not over-engineer solutions

## Plans
- Make the plan extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for brevity.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any - using the `AskUserQuestion` tool.
